# 📚 JavaScript Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript exercises and small web projects I developed as part of a JavaScript course. The goal was to deepen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts through practice — including control flow, DOM manipulation, event handling, object-oriented patterns, and unit testing with Jest.

Some projects are guided, some are extended with my own ideas.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals by building interactive, real-world projects
- Understand data types, loops, functions, and objects in depth
- Learn how to manipulate the DOM and handle browser events
- Explore basic testing with Jest
- Lay the groundwork for later work in TypeScript and frameworks like React
